I am a PhD candidate in Economics and Public Policy at [Tufts University](https://as.tufts.edu/economics/) and a fellow at [Tufts Institute of the Environment](https://environment.tufts.edu/).

My research interests are in environmental and energy economics.

I also work as a consultant at the World Bank Group's Carbon Markets and Innovation group and a lead contributor to the [State and Trends of Carbon Pricing](https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/handle/10986/35620) report and the [Carbon Pricing Dashboard](https://carbonpricingdashboard.worldbank.org/).
