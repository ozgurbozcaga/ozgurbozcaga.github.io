I am a senior economist (associate consultant equivalent) at McKinsey & Company's sustainability practice. I received my Ph.D. in Economics and Public Policy from [Tufts University](https://as.tufts.edu/economics/) in 2022. At Tufts, I was also a [Tufts Institute of the Environment](https://environment.tufts.edu/) fellow.

My research interests are in environmental and energy economics, and wider socio-economic implications of environmental regulations.

Previously, I worked as a consultant at the World Bank Group's Carbon Markets and Innovation group. I was a lead contributor to the [State and Trends of Carbon Pricing](https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/handle/10986/35620) report and the [Carbon Pricing Dashboard](https://carbonpricingdashboard.worldbank.org/).
