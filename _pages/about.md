I am an energy and climate economist at The World Bank Group's Climate Change Group, where I lead technical cooperation programmes and economic impact modeling for climate policies across transition economies. I hold a Ph.D. in Economics and Public Policy from [Tufts University](https://as.tufts.edu/economics/) where I was a [Tufts Institute of the Environment](https://environment.tufts.edu/) fellow.

My expertise spans low-carbon economy transition, sustainable finance implementation, and climate economics, with a focus on translating complex economic analyses into actionable strategies for governments, financial institutions, and private sector stakeholders. I have a proven track record of technical cooperation delivery, climate policy instrument design, and green investment development across Europe, Central Asia, Latin America, and MENA regions.

Previously, I was a senior economist at McKinsey & Company, advising major financial institutions and governments on sustainable finance initiatives, decarbonization strategies and climate risk assessment. I have been a lead contributor to the [State and Trends of Carbon Pricing](https://www.worldbank.org/en/publication/state-and-trends-of-carbon-pricing) reports since 2019, working with +100 carbon pricing jurisdiction globally, and currently manage the [Carbon Pricing Dashboard](https://carbonpricingdashboard.worldbank.org/), covering +150 carbon pricing instruments worldwide.
