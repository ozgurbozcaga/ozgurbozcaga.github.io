I am a PhD candidate in Economics and Public Policy at [Tufts University](https://as.tufts.edu/economics/).

My research interests are in environmental and energy economics.

I also work as a consultant at the World Bank Group's Carbon Markets and Innovation group and a lead contributor to [State and Trends of Carbon Pricing](https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/handle/10986/35620) and the [Carbon Pricing Dashboard](https://carbonpricingdashboard.worldbank.org/).

Prior to my academic studies I worked at the Turkish government, Economic Development Foundation and the World Water Forum Secretariat.
