My name is Mustafa Ozgur Bozcaga and I am a PhD candidate in Economics and Public Policy at Tufts University.

My research interests are in environmental and energy economics.

Prior to my academic studies I worked at the Turkish government, Economic Development Foundation and the World Water Forum Secretariat.

I am also a consultant at the World Bank Group's Carbon Markets and Innovation group and a lead contributor to State and Trends of Carbon Pricing and the Carbon Pricing Dashboard.
