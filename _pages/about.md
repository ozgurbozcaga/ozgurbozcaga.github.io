I am an energy and climate economist at The World Bank Group's Climate Change Group, where I lead carbon pricing policy research and economic impact modeling across emerging markets. I hold a Ph.D. in Economics and Public Policy from [Tufts University](https://as.tufts.edu/economics/) where I was a [Tufts Institute of the Environment](https://environment.tufts.edu/) fellow.

My expertise spans environmental policy design, sustainable finance, and energy economics, with a focus on translating complex economic analyses into actionable strategies for governments and corporations. I specialize in economic impact and energy systems modeling, and carbon market infrastructure development.

Previously, I was a senior economist at McKinsey & Company's sustainability practice, advising major financial institutions and governments on decarbonization strategies and climate target setting. I have been a lead contributor to the [State and Trends of Carbon Pricing](https://www.worldbank.org/en/publication/state-and-trends-of-carbon-pricing) reports since 2019 and currently manage the [Carbon Pricing Dashboard](https://carbonpricingdashboard.worldbank.org/), covering over 150 carbon pricing instruments worldwide.
